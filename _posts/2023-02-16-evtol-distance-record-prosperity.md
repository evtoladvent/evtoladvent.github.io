On 23 February, AutoFlight's Generation 4 eVTOL aircraft, Prosperity I flew a distance of 250.3 kilometres (155.5 miles) on a single battery charge from the testing facility in Jining, China.

The remotely piloted flight lasted 1 hour 38 minutes and included 20 circuits of a predefined route.

This long-range test flight was verified as the longest eVTOL flight in history using FAA-approved avionics as well as third-party ForeFlight technology to record and verify the achievement.

AutoFlight states that this is a key milestone on its path to obtaining certification of the Prosperity I aircraft from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
