EASA has proposed rules for safe operations of Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft (VTOL), which includes air taxis.

The [Opinion](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/opinions/opinion-no-032023) introduces a comprehensive set of operational requirements for piloted electric air taxis, spanning the domains of operations, flight crew licensing, rules of the air and air traffic management. The proposed rules also establish criteria and processes for the certification and maintenance of drones.
